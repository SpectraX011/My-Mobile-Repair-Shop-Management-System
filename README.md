# My-Mobile-Repair-Shop-Management-System

This system was created using NetBeans IDE and Java Swing.
It was developed for my father, who works at the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) and has side jobs repairing mobile phones. He asked me to build a management tool for his customers so that he would no longer need to manually prepare Excel sheets. The system helps organize customer records and reduces the hassle of tracking repair requests, making his workflow smoother and more efficient.
